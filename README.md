# Simple Web Scraper Bot for news links
## Personal Project writtern by Navraj Eari

- Grabs the news links from a mobile games webpage when an update arrives, and uploads it to a community forum page.
- Code use to run from a google cloud, however now runs locally from my computer at set intervals with Windows Task Scheduler.
- To use, simply run the .py file.
- "client_secrets.json" file not included for obvious reasons.
